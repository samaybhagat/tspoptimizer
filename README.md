# TSP Optimizer
This code is solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with a 5-node (or point) adjency matrix. Initially, a brute-force method is used to identify the most optimal route, but this is then followed with a VQE algorithm with the same goal. 

In more complex situations, methods like brute-force are often considered obselete as it's difficult to simulate many different nodes all at once and find the optimal route. VQEs shine in opportunities like these, and make the process of finding the solution much easier. Check out my code to see how you can do this yourself!
